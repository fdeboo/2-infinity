# Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
The 2infinity travel shop was created to fulfill the final project requirements to design and build an e-commerce web app. The idea of a space travel website was chosen as a something unusual and fun but within the coming decade, could occupy a real niche. The web app has been built using the Django framework and its extensions. Data is captured and stored in a relational database and payments are handled by Stripe.

The site can be enjoyed [here](https://toinfinity.herokuapp.com/)

# UX <a name="userexperience"></a>
## Goals
### Purpose
The purpose of the app is to provide a way for users to book and pay for trips to a range of space destinations for themselves and other passengers whom they nominate.

### Target Audience
The site envisages a time in the near future when space travel will become safe for the casual traveller and space tourist. The site functions for this audience in the manner of air travel sites that we know today. The site would appeal to travellers looking for unique destinations, to space enthusiasts, and to those looking for unusual experiences.

### The App helps to achieve this by:
+ Simply and attractively displaying the available destinations
+ Providing a straight forward booking process modelled on the familiar workflow of existing air travel sites (eg. [Kenmore Air](https://www.kenmoreair.com)).

## Design Notes <a name="design"></a>

### Fonts
The fonts for this project were sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

+ **"Montserrat"** is the main font used for the body text, links, buttons and subheadings. It was chosen because of its easy legibility and low contrast strokes that give it a clean, modern feel. The font comes in a good range weights which make it flexible for emphasising words in bold or adding subtle hover effect to links. Montserrat pairs well with the secondary font because of its smooth, circular curves that contrast with the square form of Orbitron's letters,

+ The secondary font used for this app is **"Orbitron"**, a sans serif font reminiscent of futuristic sci-fi movies. The geometric typeface was designed for display purposes and as such, is used for 2infinity's main logo and headings. It was chosen for its strong futuristic character which supports the theme of the app.

+ The font used for the hero text on the landing page is **"Euphoria Script"**. It was chosen to contrast the main display font (Orbitron) for added interest. It is set to a large font size for maximum impact and legibility and given a text shadow which matches the base cyan colour chosen for the site.

### Icons
The majority of 2infinity's icons were provided by the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icon library.
+ Icons are used as visual cues against each of the navigation links in the header.
+ Social Media Icons are included in the footer in lieu of written links as the icons are more immediately recognizable.
+ On the user profile page, the table headings are shortened by using icons to save space.
+ The booking progress bar uses icons to illustrate the process steps and intuitively communicate the stage reached and steps remaining.
+ The site uses a custom mouse cursor for fun, with a design that echoes the theme of the site and gives the impression of a space shuttle freely roaming through outer space. The vector icon was created in Adobe Illustrator.  

    ![Shuttle Icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/fdeboo/image/upload/v1611957910/toinfinity_readme/shuttleicon_3_qcbrdj.png)

### Colours
[Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create) was used to develop the colours for 2infinty.

The brand has a dark theme to reflect the darkness of outer space. Cyan, used for the base colour, is a bright, additive secondary colour created by mixing blue and green light. It captures the glow of Earth as viewed from space.


#### Base 
**#2AB1B7**: Used for h1 Headings, borders, underlines, the hero button and the footer.
![Base Cyan](https://res.cloudinary.com/fdeboo/image/upload/v1611949566/toinfinity_readme/Screenshot_2021-01-29_at_19.45.51_dmwfre.png)
 
#### Split Complementary
 **#B88421**: Warnings & form errors

![Split Complementary Colours](https://res.cloudinary.com/fdeboo/image/upload/v1611907001/toinfinity_readme/splitcomplementary_a1zubd.png "Split Complementary Colours")

#### Complementary
**#0E666B**: Text in the page footer. The contrast from the base cyan is enough to be legible without grabbing too much attention

![Complementary Colours](https://res.cloudinary.com/fdeboo/image/upload/v1611906923/toinfinity_readme/complementary_ueacnx.png "Complementary Colours")

#### Monochromatic
**#0D3638**: Bottom border colour for form inputs

![Monochromatic Colours](https://res.cloudinary.com/fdeboo/image/upload/v1611906927/toinfinity_readme/monochromatic_lokvxw.png "Monochromatic Colours")

#### Square
**#99B821**: For links, highlighting selected options and progress bar icons.

## Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a>

### Base Skeleton  
+ The [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework was used extensively throughout the app to achieve responsive layouts.

+ The pager header, containing the navigation links and company logo, is anchored to the top of the viewport window and has a high z-index so that the page content scrolls behind it.

+ When the entire body fits within the viewport height, the footer anchors to bottom of the screen while the main content 'grows' to fill the remaining space.

+ If the main content overflows the viewport height, the content becomes scrollable and the footer is positioned as per default, in the normal flow of the page.  

+ The content is structured using Bootstrap's Grid System. On all screen sizes, the containing elements - **header**, **main**, and **footer** are given the class **"container-fluid"** so that the background extends across the full width of the screen.

+ The content within the **header** and **main** elements is contained within a content column. This is a full width column (**"col-12"**) on small devices, but reduced to 83.33\% width on viewports wider than 991px, to allow a margin on the left and right of content (**"col-md-10"**)

+ On all devices, the content column within the footer is set to (**"col-12"**) which gives the page a solid base.

&nbsp;
### AllAuth Templates 

+ The templates to sign in, sign up and sign out all conform to the base structure of the app; The header is anchored at the top and the main content is centered vertically and horizontally, filling the space between the header and the footer at the bottom of the screen.

+ The individual forms are the only features of their respective templates and are styled as per the form style.

+ On larger screen sizes the forms are contained by a 1px solid border in the base teal colour. On mobile devices, the border is removed as viewport comfortably takes over as the form's 'container'.

# Features <a name="existing_feat"></a>
## Existing Features <a name="future_feat"></a>

### Home App
+ The layout of the landing page is minimalistic and draws the user directly to the hero button as starting point for their navigation.

+ The page is filled with a dynamic full screen background image of the Earth photographed from space. The image is fixed so that image appears to zoom in and out when the viewport is resized but keeps its position on the page. 

+ The base cyan colour is used to catch the eye as it stands out againt the dark theme. In this template, it is used in the header section to underline the hovered navigation links, in the main section for the hero button and effect on the hero text, and for footer. This keeps the overall template nicely balanced.


### Booking App
+ The booking process relies on Django sessions to store the users input and uses the session data to model the forms. In normal workflow, the booking is not created in the database until the user has successfully completed the checkout and made payment.  However they can choose to save the booking prior to checkout and come back to it later. In this case the booking is saved in a model with an 'OPEN' status. 

+ Since many of the forms in the booking process rely on data from the session, checks are made early on in the logic before rendering the page to see that all of the required session data exists. If it doesn't, it redirects the user to a custom error template where they find a link back to the search form. This prevents a user who may have typed in a url without following the booking process from receiving a server error.

![Customised Session Error](https://res.cloudinary.com/fdeboo/image/upload/v1612021457/toinfinity_readme/sessionerrortemplate_mb4zxq.png "No Session Data")

+ The booking process is reserved for authenticated users and therefore if a user tries to search a trip without being logged in, they are directed to the sign in page.

#### Progress Bar

![Progress Bar](https://res.cloudinary.com/fdeboo/image/upload/v1611906942/toinfinity_readme/progressbar_fq5nmi.png "Progress Bar")
+ The templates in the booking process feature a progress bar just beneath the main navigation bar. This is positioned 'sticky' so that it retains its position if the page requires scrolling.

* The progress bar benefits the user experience as it informs them of where they are in the booking process.

+ The progress bar first appears in the 'Search Trips View'/ when the user clicks the 'Book A Trip' link in the page header.

+ Each icon in the progress bar is a hyperlink that takes the user back to the respective step in the booking process.

+ The active step, and the steps that preceed it are shown in colour and their links are enabled. The steps beyond the active step are greyed out and the links are disabled. The exceptions to this are the Checkout and Checkout Success templates where all the links preceeding the active step are disabled.

+ On smaller screen sizes, the size of the progress bar icons reduces slightly to keep in proportion with the space.


#### Search Trips Form

![Search Trips](https://res.cloudinary.com/fdeboo/image/upload/v1611907015/toinfinity_readme/searchtripsform_omwcg3.png "Search Trips")
+ The form appears in the 'Search Trips' template but is also featured on the 'View Trips' page

+ The Passengers field is disabled until a Destination is selected from the dropdown list.
This is so that the **max** attribute for the passengers input is dynamically set using jquery when it detects a change in the Destination field.    


```
$('#selected-trip').change(function() {
    if ($('#selected-trip').val() == '') {
        $('#passengers-max').prop("disabled", true);
    }
    else {
        let maxNm = $('#selected-trip option:selected').data('maxNum');         
        $('#passengers-max').attr("max", maxNm).prop("disabled", false);
    }
});
```

+ For this to work, I created a custom widget, sublassing Django's Select widget and customising its 'create_option' method.  The customised method allows the **max\_passengers** value for the represented destination instance, to be be passed as a data attribute to the option element.

```
def create_option(
        self, name, value, label, selected, index, subindex=None, attrs=None
    ):
        if isinstance(label, dict):
            opt_attrs = label.copy()
            label = opt_attrs.pop("label")
        else:
            opt_attrs = {}
        option_dict = super(SelectOptionsWithAttributes, self).create_option(
            name, value, label, selected, index, subindex=subindex, attrs=attrs
        )
        for key, val in opt_attrs.items():
            option_dict["attrs"][key] = val
        return option_dict
```

+ The form has validation setup on its <code>def_clean(self)</code> method so that the data is cleaned even after it passes the intitial browser validation. This prevents any hacking from the developer tools.
It checks that: 
    + The Destination submitted is in fact an instance of the Destination Model. Returns error: "Please choose an option from the list"
    + The date selected is not in the past. Returns error: ""Searched date should not be in the past"
    + The value submitted for number of passengers does not exceed the number of seats that the Destination can accommodate. Returns error: "Sorry, this exceeds the maximum for the selected trip"
    + The value submitted for number of passengers is not less than 1. Returns error: "Please choose at least one passenger".    


#### Confirm Trips Form

+ The form contains a set of radio input options based on a filtered queryset. The Trips are initially filtered by 'destination' and then by 'seats available'. The set of options is further refined to the dates closest to the date that the user requested.

+ The Confirm Trip form is rendered using data from the session. Therefore checks are made to see that the required session objects exist. If they do not exist the user is redirected to a custom error page with the message "It seems the session has ended" and a button to take them back to the search form.

+ Before loading the template and attempting to return any results, a check occurs to see if there are any trips available at all for the destination and requested number of passengers. If all trips are fully booked, the user is redirected to an error page and presented a button link to go back and start a new search.

![Custom Error Message](https://res.cloudinary.com/fdeboo/image/upload/v1612038944/toinfinity_readme/noavailabilityerror_mdeqty.png)


+ The radio buttons are hidden in favor of custom styled input labels which display the date, and price per person.


![Customised Radio Inputs](https://res.cloudinary.com/fdeboo/image/upload/v1611906970/toinfinity_readme/customradiobtn_iys5yk.png "Custom Radio Inputs")

+ Customisation is applied to Django's 'label_from_instance' method so that the label represents both the price and date of the instance

```
    def label_from_instance(self, obj):
        # 'obj' will be a Destination
        date_string = (obj.date).strftime("%A %d %B %Y")
        return f"{date_string} £{obj.destination.price}"
```

+ The markup of the label is constructed using jquery. When the page loads, it takes the value of each label and slices it so that price and date can be returned  as separate html elements within the parent label.

+ When the option is submitted, a modal is triggered to confirm the choices the passenger has made.

#### Passenger Formset

+ The Formset receives a value from the session for the the number of passengers in the booking and uses it to define the number of forms in the formset.

+ The Formset also receives the trip instance from the session and uses it to determine which 'addons' to present to the user

+ The Passenger Details form is rendered using data from the session. Therefore checks are made to see that the required session objects exist. If they do not exist the user is redirected to a custom error page with the message "It seems the session has ended" and a button to take them back to the search form.

+ The Addons for the trip are represented as a set of checkboxes but the checkboxes use a custom template for improved styling.
![Custom Checkboxes](https://res.cloudinary.com/fdeboo/image/upload/v1611906926/toinfinity_readme/customcheckboxes_hozdm9.png "Custom Checkboxes")

+ The form has custom validation defined in its <code>def_clean(self)</code> method to verify the data that is submitted. It checks that:
    + The passport number has been provided for each passenger since it is a required field. Returns error: "This field is required."
    + The passport number does not already exist within a booking for the same trip. Returns error: "Error, please check passport number or contact us"
    + The passport number is not submitted twice within the same formset. Returns error: "".
    + Details have been provided for all forms in the formset. Returns error: "Please provide details for all travellers."

#### Booking Summary

+ A summary of items that the user is due to purchase appears in both the Passenger Details template and the Checkout template. The itemised summary shows each item on a separate row with the individual item price and quantity (number of passengers it applies to). A booking total is calculated and shown beneath the listed items.

![Booking Summmary](https://res.cloudinary.com/fdeboo/image/upload/v1612021370/toinfinity_readme/bookingsummary_cx0pkc.png)

+ In the Passenger Details template, the booking summary initially displays the Trip which is being booked as the only 'product' item that has been selected at that step in the booking process. However, the summary features an 'Update' button which, when clicked, triggers the jquery to select all checked inputs from each passenger form and generate the html markup that appends the Addon products to the summary. The booking total is also updated.

+ The script first removes any markup beyond the listed trip in case it is in not the first time script has been triggered. This prevents the same Addon product being listed multiple times from previous click events.

+ Instead, the itemised list of Addon products is refreshed and any reoccurances (the same product selected by multiple passengers) is accounted for by incrementing the 'quantity' and subtotal.

#### Save for later
+ Just before the user proceeds to the checkout, they are presented with two alternative submit buttons. The 'Save for Later' button allows the user to save the booking to their profile if they are not ready to check out at that point.
+ The booking instance is saved and given a status of OPEN. They can access this booking from their Profile page and return to complete it another day.
#### Cancel
+ If the user gets to Passenger Details template and then decides they don't want to proceed with the booking, they can choose to 'cancel'. Pressing this button deletes all session data and redirects them back to the home page.

### Checkout App
+ The Checkout form is rendered using data from the session. Therefore checks are made to see that the required session objects exist. If they do not exist the user is redirected to a custom error page with the message "It seems the session has ended" and a button to take them back to the search form.

+ A check is also made to verify that there are still seats available on the trip for the number of passengers requested by the booking since it is possible that in the time since the initial search was made, the number available seats has changed.

    ```
    if trip.seats_available < passenger_total:
                template_name = "checkout/seats-unavailable.html"
                context = {
                    "destination": trip.destination,
                    "date": trip.date,
                    "passengers": passenger_total,
                }
                return render(request, template_name, context)
    ```
    If the check finds that there are no longer seats available for this trip, it redirects the user to a custom error page.
    ![Custom Error Template](https://res.cloudinary.com/fdeboo/image/upload/v1612021451/toinfinity_readme/seatsunavailable_jun0dt.png)

+ A final check is made to see that the trip being 'purchased' is not in the past since the user may have saved their booking and returned to it many weeks later when the trip has already taken place. If this is the case, the user is prevented from reaching the checkout page and redirected to a custom error page instead where they can navigate back to their profile.

    ```
    if datetime_naive < datetime.today():
                if self.booking:
                    self.booking.delete()
                template_name = "checkout/date-passed.html"
                context = {
                    "date": trip.date,
                }
                return render(request, template_name, context)
    ```

    ![Custom Error Template](https://res.cloudinary.com/fdeboo/image/upload/v1612021682/toinfinity_readme/pasttriperror_qvaxfl.png)


+ Within the checkout template, a clear message is shown just below the 'Proceed to Checkout' button, warns the user how much will they be charged.
+ The checkout system implements Stripe(devlopment version) for handling test payments
+ To test checkout, users can enter 4242 4242 4242 4242 for the credit card number
+ Webhooks are set up, so the order is created only after Stripe accepts the payment as valid.
+ Once the Webhook return a success status, the  user receives an email to confirming their booking
+ A Toast message confirms that their order has been successful.
+ On success, the system renders a new template with a full summary of the booking and a thank you message.
+ After successfully checking out the booking instance is created in the database if not already. If the booking instance does already exist, the booking is updated to a status of "COMPLETE"
+ When the booking is saved, the <code>update_seats_available()</code> method is called on the Trips model, prompting it to deduct the number of passengers created in the booking from the number of available seats.

```
reservations = self.bookings.filter(status="COMPLETE").aggregate(
            num_passengers=Count("passengers")
        )["num_passengers"]
        self.save(reservations=reservations)

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Override the original save method to set the trip reference and
        seats_available if not set already
        """

        if not self.trip_ref:
            date = (self.date).strftime("%m%d-%y")
            self.trip_ref = self.destination.pk + "-" + date

        reservations = kwargs.pop("reservations", 0)
        self.seats_available = self.destination.max_passengers - reservations
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)
```

## Future Features

+ Product management within the App
Currently administrators can login to the Django admin which has been set up with all models registered. In a future feature, the app will give administrator only access to templates where they can submit forms to update, create or delete products.

+ Users will be able to delete their accounts

+ Asynchronous Housekeeping  
This enhancement would aim to implement structures that make it easy introduce asynchronous housekeeping as requirements are identified, the first example being removal from the database of expired open bookings--bookings created and saved, perhaps by one-time visitors to the site, but never completed.  Any open bookings against expired trips would be targets for this housekeeping.  There are two parts to the implementation of each asynchronous housekeeping requirement:

    + A Python script that executes the specific housekeeping; in the case of expired open bookings, the sole objective of the script is to issue an database query along the lines of "BEGIN; DELETE BOOKING WHERE BOOKING.STATUS = 'Open' AND BOOKING.TRIP = TRIP.PK AND TRIP.DATE < CURRENT_DATE; END"

    + A means to schedule the periodic execution of the script which, in the case of open bookings, is the frequency with which open bookings may become expired.  This would be explored using some combination of Django async views, the Django-Q addon, and Heroku Redis as a queue dispatching service. 

    + Thereafter, each additional housekeeping requirement would be implemented by creating the appropriate housekeeping script, and the additional statements within the async view to invoke the script on the appropriate scheduling basis.

+ Passenger Medical Assessments    
At the moment, 2Infinity bookings accept any Passengers named by the user.  But flights to deep space, or addons such as space walks or space buggy rides, may not be suitable for certain Passengers based on age (too young or too old) or certain medical or physical conditions.  The enhancement would introduce a model whereby each Passenger could be issued with a medical assessment questionnaire, the completion of which becomes a condition for accepting the Passenger for the Trip.  Theoretically, the 2Infinity shop could communicate with a nominated GP for each Passenger to receive the GP's verdict on the Passenger's suitability for the Trip Booking and addon activities.

# Testing <a name="testing"></a>

Features of 2Infinity were tested as they were developed, and re-tested in an ad hoc fashion as updates to the app continued.

Critical path functions of the app were identified, and testing focused on ensuring that these remained functional.  Critical path functions include:

+ To register an account
+ To sign in with a registered account
+ To search for a trip (2 forms)
+ To book a trip and “Confirm”
+ To add passengers (with add-ons) and “Proceed”
+ To complete the “Checkout” process and “Complete Order”
+ Functions necessary to meet project requirements (e.g., view and amend the profile for a registered account)

Formal and automated testing methods and assets were not developed.

A close family member was introduced to the website on its deployed location and briefed about its purpose and critical path functions.  There subsequent use of the app helped to draw attention to defects and identify opportunities for enhancing usability.

# Deployment <a name="deploying"></a>

## Run Locally <a name="local"></a>

> In order to run the project locally, you will need an IDE, PIP, Python (version 3) and Git installed.
> You will need to set up a free account with Stripe and with AWS for a S3 bucket.

1. Visit the 2infinity repository on Github; [https://github.com/fdeboo/to-infinity](https://github.com/fdeboo/to-infinity) and click on ![Code](https://res.cloudinary.com/fdeboo/image/upload/v1611914876/toinfinity_readme/clone_trqifl.png) to clone or download it.
2. Either:

* Click to **Download Zip** and save the folder somewhere on your local system
    * File > Open the project from within your IDE
    * Copy the web url. In the terminal of your IDE, change directory / `cd` to where you want the project saved on your system.
* **or**:
    * Type `git clone` and paste in the copied web url to complete the command *(as below)

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/fdeboo/to-infinity.git
    ```
3. Activate a virtual environment. For this, I recommend using the **pipenv** package which manages the virtualenv and automatically adds/removes packages to a Pipfile when they are un/installed.

> *NOTE: The Pipfile created by **pipenv** supersedes the requirements.txt*

* Once pipenv insalled, activate it with the following command:
    <code data-te-codeblock="">pipenv shell</code>
    * On MacOS, pipenv is installed simply by typing `brew install pipenv` in the Mac Terminal. You can read more about pipenv and its installation using other software [here](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/).
4. Install the project dependencies detailed in the Pipfile by typing

```
pipenv install
```

5. Set up a .env file in the project root and provide the folllowing environment variables:

> *Important! Make sure you set up a .gitignore file and list .env in it so that it is ignored in commits to GitHub*

    ```
    SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET=your_stripe_wh_secret
    DEVELOPMENT=True
    ```

*for guidance on where to obtain these values click [here](#guidance)*
6. If using VSCode, or else if necessary, restart the IDE and reactivate the virtual environment (as per step 3)
7. Migrate the admin panel models to create the database template:

```
 python3 manage.py migrate
```

8. Create a 'superuser' account for access to the django admin panel:

```
 python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

9. Finally, run the app locally with the following command:

```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

## Deploying to Heroku <a name="heroku"></a>

# Bugs <a name="bugs"></a>

1. Circular import issue.  
**Cause:** I initially listed the 'Trip' model within the products app. I imported the 'Booking' model from the bookings app so that I could place an aggregate Query on the Booking objects and use the data returned to update the trip object. In the bookings app, I required the Trip model to be imported and used as a positional argument in a ForeignKey within the Booking model. This resulted in a circular import and caused an Import Error.  
**Solution:** There were a couple of solutions to this issue. One option was to use lazy evaluation and pass products.Trip as a string in the ForeignKey, instead of just defining the model name. This would the alleviate the need to create an import. However, I did not want to use a lazy lookup so as to protect the app's performance. Instead, I reconsidered the arrangement of the models within the app and was able to solve the issue quite easily by moving the Trip model to the booking app and updating the imports as necessary.
2. 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'model'  
**Cause:** When the DateChoiceForm is initialised, the queryset attribute on the ModelChoiceField is overidden with a dynamically generated queryset passed in the \*\*kwargs. If no key is found in the \*\*kwargs, the default value returned is None.
The DateChoiceForm is instantiated again with request.POST when it comes to retrieving the form's POST data. The problem was that the paramater required to initialise the form was not provided. Therefore the kwarg was taking the fallback value of None and subsequently setting the value of the queryset to None.  
**Solution:** I refactored the code so that a view that renders a form in it's get method also handles the form's POST data in it's post method. Since the DateChoiceForm is dynamically rendered using data from the SearchTripsForm, I passed the SearchTripForm's input values to the session so that it could be accessed from the view associated with the DateChoiceForm. Within this view, I created a series of custom class methods to retrieve the data from the session and generate a queryset with it. The class methods were available to view's default get and post method which meant that the DateChoiceForm could be inititalised with the same queryset in both the post and get methods.
3. User model imported from django.contrib.auth.models
This error has been reported [See here](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/issues/278)

## Code

* I was greatly inspired by the Boutique Ado Walkthrough prject provided by Code Institute. Much of the code for the Checkout and Webhooks was based on the project code.

+ The [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/) provides a very comprehensive guide to it's features and was my main point of reference and source of all my learning about Django models, Model Relationships, Class Based Views, Forms, and queries.

* The [Try DJANGO Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oOHlcHkX2U&list=PLEsfXFp6DpzTD1BD1aWNxS2Ep06vIkaeW&index=23) youtube series *(Episode 23-28)*, by Coding Entrepreneurs helped me understand the advantages of Django Forms

* [HTML5 Date Input With Django Forms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2-JYxnSiB0) by Pretty Printed

* [Advanced Form Rendering with Django Crispy Forms](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/11/28/advanced-form-rendering-with-django-crispy-forms.html) by Vitor Freitas was a clear and concise explanation of how to use and customise crispy forms. It inspired me to provide my own templates for the checkboxes in the Passenger Details formset.

+ Vitor Freitas' anwaser in his [AskVitor](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/questions/2017/03/22/how-to-dynamically-filter-modelchoices-queryset-in-a-modelform.html) feature helped me grasp how to channel the search results from form to form, particulary in rendering the Confirm trips View which was based on a filtered queryset using the input data from the Search Form.

* I greatly valued the [Django inline formsets with Class-based views and crispy forms ](https://dev.to/zxenia/django-inline-formsets-with-class-based-views-and-crispy-forms-14o6) post, by Xenia from the Dev Community, as it provided a very simple yet comprehensive example of how to implement inline formsets within the same conditions I was working with.

* I based my booking form which used inline\_formets to created a nested passenger forms, on [Working with nested forms with Django](https://swapps.com/blog/working-with-nested-forms-with-django/) walkthrough tutorial from Swapps.

* Stack Overflow    

    The community on Stack Overflow helped me on many occasions, both in the answers to my own questions and in the answers to other users' questions. Notable posts that inspired my code are as follows:

    + I understood how to pass extra data to the select options in the Search Trips form after reading [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63293300/2342815) post by 'mglart'.

    + The code used to check for the existence of multiple session objects in one statement was posted [here.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6159329/2342815)
